    "<h3>1 . Store</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a python function which is able to store a memory in a Hopfield network.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>2 . Recall</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a python function which runs the recall algorithm for an initial (corrupted) memory. Make sure to include a stopping criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>3 . Capacity</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to determine the capacity for a Hopfield network of a given size. This function should have a size parameter, and then initialize an empty Hopfield network. It must then store a random memory and test whether the network is able to recall the correct memory if given a pattern corrupted by a single bit. The function must then return the largest number of memories that were stored and successfully recalled.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>4 . Scaling behavior</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Produce a plot showing capacity as a function of network size. What is the scaling behavior?\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>5 . (Optional) Asynchronous updates</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Change your implementation, so that the state is updated asynchronously. Find a state that didnâ€™t converge in your original implementation, and show that it does converge in your new implementation."
