CS156 is a Minerva Schools @ KGI course on Machine Learning for Science and Profit taught by professor Philip Sterne.

In this course, I apply core machine learning techniques -- such as classification, perceptron, neural networks, support vector machines, hidden Markov models, and nonparametric models of clustering -- as well as fundamental concepts such as feature selection, cross-validation and over-fitting. I also program machine learning algorithms to make sense of genetic data, perform customer segmentation, and predict the outcome of elections.
